    <p>One morning in a fit of pique<br>Sing rickety tickety tin<br>One morning in a fit of pique<br>She drowned her father in the creek<br>The water tasted bad for a week <br>And we had to make do with gin, with gin<br>We had to make do with gin</p>
    <p>Her mother she could never stand <br>Sing rickety tickety tin<br>Her mother she could never stand<br>And so a cyanide soup she planned<br>The mother died with the spoon in her hand<br>And her face in a hideous grin, a grin<br>Her face in a hideous grin.
    <p>She weighted her brother down with stones<br>Sing rickety tickety tin<br>She weighted her brother down with stones<br>And sent him off to Davey Jones<br>All they ever found were some bones<br>And occasional pieces of skin, of skin<br>Occasional pieces of skin.</p>
    <p>She set her sister's hair on fire<br>Sing rickety tickety tin<br>She set her sister's hair on fire<br>And as the smoke and flame rose higher<br>Danced around the funeral pyre<br>Playing a violin, olin<br>Playing a violin.</p>
    <p>One day she had nothing to do<br>Sing rickety tickety tin<br>One day she had nothing to do<br>She cut her baby brother in two<br>And served him up as an Irish stew<br>And invited the neighbors in, bors in<br>Invited the neighbors in.</p>
    <p>And when at last the police came by<br>Sing rickety tickety tin<br>And when at last the police came by<br>Her little pranks she did not deny<br>To do so she would have had to lie<br>And lying she knew was a sin, a sin<br>And lying she knew was a sin.</p>
    <p>And just one thing before I go<br>Sing rickety tickety tin<br>And just one thing before I go<br>There's something I think that you ought to know<br>They had no proof, so they let her go<br>And they say that she's tall and thin, and thin<br>They say that she's tall and thin.</p>
    <p>My tragic tale I won't prolong<br>Sing rickety tickety tin<br>My tragic tale I won't prolong<br>I hope you lile my little song<br>You've yourself to blame if it's too long<br>You should never have let me begin, begin<br>You should never have let me begin.</p>
